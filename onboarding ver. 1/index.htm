				<div class='content'>
<p>
The Core Beliefs Profile is a simple 5-10 minute survey-like questionnaire designed to determine the level of alignment between your views on educational mission and culture and that of the school administration, and speaks to the likelihood that a teacher will be happy at that school long term.  myEDmatch will use the results of your Core Beliefs Profile to suggest schools with similar educational missions, beliefs, and goals as your own.
</p>
<p>The questionnaire includes seven core areas of education:
<ul class="numberlist" style="padding-left:15px;">
<li>Mission -  a shared set of beliefs around the purpose, goals, and aspirations of a school</li>
<li>Instruction - a specific approach to teaching and learning used in a school</li>
<li>Professional Development - support of teachers' professional growth and advancement</li>
<li>Planning - organization around the task of teaching and learning</li>
<li>Student Culture - students' shared beliefs, values, and behaviors concerning school</li>
<li>School Environment - the management of time, people, and resources through systems and structures</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Within each area is a series of statements, about which you will select the degree to which you agree or disagree. To do so, just click on the radio button indicating your level of agreement for each statement. Don't forget to click Save after completing each core section. It should take you no more than 5-10 minutes to complete. Once you've completed this profile, you can begin searching for jobs that are right for you using our more than 20 filters via the "Jobs" tab!

				<li><b><a href='#' class='head'>Build your Professional Profile</a></b>
				<div class='content'>
<p>
Whether you're looking for your first job, your next job, or a place to showcase the awesome work you're doing in your current job, building a visually-compelling digital professional portfolio is the place to start. In addition to the basics, like detailing your education and experience, your professional profile lets you showcase yourself to schools and other teachers in a way a traditional resume can't. And the best part is, you can build it quickly and easily by following the steps below. 
</p>
<br />
<div style="padding-top:15px; padding-bottom:15px; text-align:center; margin:auto; background:#83b666; width:470px;">
<p style="text-align:left; color:#fff; font-size:14px; font-family:Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; width:425px;"><img src="images/tip_icon.png" align="left" style="padding-right:10px;" /><b>ExpertTip:</b> If you complete your profile, as reflected by the profile completion bar in the top-right corner, you can unlock premium features, which include the following: Match Scores, messaging with schools, and the ability to see which schools have favorited you. A complete profile is at least one entry in each of the 10 profile sections. <a href="#"><b>Learn more >></b></a>
</p>
</div>
<br />
<p><b>Step 1: Complete the 'header' section by adding a profile picture, First Impression, and resume.</b> This section of your profile is important because it's the first thing school recruiters and principals see when they view your profile. In other words, it's your virtual first impression.
</p>
<p>To add your profile picture, hover over the default image and click <b>Upload Profile Picture</b> (#1).
</p>
<p>To write your First Impression, click <b>edit</b>, which will open up a text field where you can craft a 140-character introduction (#2). This is a great place to share what you stand for! 
</p>
<p>To upload your resume, click on the <b>Upload Resume</b> button (#3). A blue icon will appear below the button when your resume has been successfully uploaded.
</p>
<div style="text-align:center; margin:auto; padding-top:10px; padding-bottom:10px;"><img src="images/profileheader.png" /></div>
<br />
<p><b>Step 2: Add your work, education, and leadership experience.</b> Continue building your professional profile and portfolio by adding your personal details, including photos and videos, in each section. Just click <b>Add New</b> or <b>Upload</b> in the upper-right corner of each section. Make sure to hit <b>Save</b> then <b>Done</b> when uploading content.
</p>
<br />
<div style="padding-top:15px; padding-bottom:15px; text-align:center; margin:auto; background:#83b666; width:470px;">
<p style="text-align:left; color:#fff; font-size:14px; font-family:Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; width:425px;"><img src="images/tip_icon.png" align="left" style="padding-right:10px;" /><b>ExpertTip:</b>  Whether in the classroom, your previous career, or in your undergraduate program, school leaders want to know where you've made measurable impact. Just as important, they want to see evidence of a growth mindset. So, share your accomplishments as well as your goals for professional development.
</p>
<br />
</div>
<div style="padding-top:15px; padding-bottom:15px; text-align:center; margin:auto;"><img src="images/workexperience.png" /></div>
<br />
<p><b>Step 3: Add endorsements from administrators, colleagues, professors, even students and parents.</b> When principals and recruiters hear: "Hire, [Insert Your Name Here]!" from people who know your work, they get excited. So, the Endorsements section of your profile makes it easy for you to invite others to vouch for your skills. 
</p>
<p>Just click <b>Request Endorsements</b> and then select from whom you'd like to receive an endorsement. 
</p>
<br />
<div style="padding-top:15px; padding-bottom:15px; text-align:center; margin:auto;"><img src="images/requestendorsements.png" /></div>
<br />
<p>When you click <b>Request Endorsement</b> again, myEDmatch automatically sends an email to the selected individual(s) inviting him/her to write a quick endorsement.</p>
<div style="padding-top:15px; padding-bottom:15px; text-align:center; margin:auto;"><img src="images/requestendorsements2.png" /></div>
<p><b>Step 4: (Optional) Link to your DonorsChoose.org account.</b> Click <b>Add</b> in the upper-right corner of the portfolio section under Leadership. Enter your DonorsChoose.org ID number. 
</p>
<p>If you don't know your number, log into your DonorsChoose.org account, place your cursor over you name in the upper-right corner, and click <b>Account</b>. Scroll to the bottom of the page where your <b>Teacher ID Number</b> is listed. Copy it over to your myEDmatch profile, and you're all set!
</p>
<p><b>Step 5: (Optional) Ask a mentor to review your profile and make notes for improvement.</b> Click <b>Share Private Link with Mentor</b> and you can either retrieve your personal myEDmatch URL to share directly with your mentor or myEDmatch can send a request via email for you.

<p>After you've worked hard to build your professional profile, don't keep it under wraps. Share it on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and in emails - because although myEDmatch is one of of the best ways to find a teaching job these days, one method continues to work better than any other: word of mouth. 
</p>
<p>First, make sure your privacy settings are set to <b>anyone</b>. Then, to share it on social media, click the appropriate blue share button(s) located in the top-right corner of your profile.

<p>The Core Beliefs Profile provides us a glimpse into your school's mission, culture, and instructional model. Taking no more than 5-10 minutes to complete, we use this profile to determine how good of a "fit" an applicant is for your specific school. <b>To promote retention, Principals are the only individuals at schools who can fill out the Core Beliefs Profile.</b> This is because school leaders are integral to the culture of school, and study after study have shown that misalignment with the mission, vision, and culture set by the school's administration is the primary driver of teacher attrition.  Your specific answers to each question will be kept private and will not be shared with potential candidates, but our "Match Score" is calculated on the basis of your answers to these questions.
</p>
<br />
<p>Here's how principals complete the Core Beliefs Profile:
</p>
<p><b>Step 1: When your school account has been activated, your principal will receive an email prompting for password reset. Principals will need to follow the link in that initial email to update their password and begin filling out some basic information and the Core Beliefs Profile.
</b></p>
<br />
<div style="padding-top:15px; padding-bottom:15px; text-align:center; margin:auto;"><img src="images/mempassword.jpg" /></div>

<p><b>Step 2: Upon password reset, when you log into the system, you will need to fill in some basic demographic information about yourself and your school.

<p><b>Step 3: The last step is to respond to questions about your school's mission, staff culture, professional development, instruction, planning, student culture, and school environment.</b> Once you have completed this brief, 5-10 minute survey, you will be able to access our portal, view Culture Match Scores and use our arsenal of convenience features.

<p>Completing your public profile on myEDmatch is quick and intuitive, and is the easiest way to market your school and attract potential candidates. Follow the steps below to build a profile that is compelling and that introduces potential candidates to your school.

Taking the time to create a compelling profile now can help attract great candidates, whereas a profile that is less well-managed could turn potential candidates away.
</p>
</div>
<br />
<p><b>Step 1: Start by adding your school's logo to your profile.</b> Simply "hover" (put your mouse over) the circle image until you see text that says "Upload Profile Picture."

<br />
<div style="padding-top:15px; padding-bottom:15px; text-align:center; margin:auto;"><img src="images/profilepic.jpg" />
</div>
<br />
<p>You can also upload a background image to the horizontal box at the top of your page. You can upload an image of any size into this box. Smaller images will be placed on a black "chalkboard" background as in the above image. If you don't like the chalkboard border around your image, you can upload an image that is 1280 pixels by 275 pixels. If you don't have software that allows you to do this easily, try using the free photo cropping tool at <a href="http://www.fotor.com/features/crop.html" target="_blank">www.fotor.com</a>.
</p>
<br />
<p><b>Step 2: Fill in written content on your public profile.</b> The information in the green circles will have been automatically filled based upon the principal's answers to the initial school demographic section during sign-up. If these sections are blank, please ask your principal to complete the 5-10 minute profile. You will not be able to see match scores of candidates until the principal completes this brief survey. Once this is completed, in the Public profile, sections we encourage you to complete include: "Our Mission," "Student Achievement Results," "In Our Own Words,"  "Leadership Opportunities," and "Living Here," in addition to uploading photos or videos to the "slider" sections as described in the next section.

<p>myEDmatch gives schools the power to search and sort for specific candidates unlike ever before using over a dozen different filters that school leaders like you have told us they care most about. Here are a few tips when getting started looking for teachers.
</p>
<br />
<p><b>Step 1: If you are part of a network/district with multiple schools, make sure that you select a school from the dropdown menu so you are viewing the page as that school, or you will be unable to view match scores.</b>  If you're a single site school you won't have to worry about this. <span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Match Scores will appear blank for candidates until the principal at the school has completed the 5-10 minute Core Beliefs Profile.</b></span>
</p>
<br />
<div style="text-align:center; margin:auto; padding-top:5px; padding-bottom:5px;"><img src="images/schoolteachersreport.jpg" />
</div>
<br />
<p><b>Step 2: Next, pick from the list of your job postings to automatically apply job specific filters for that position.</b>  You should see automatic filters appear in the Active Filters box for Certification, Grade Level Preference, Minimum Years of Experience, and Preferred Subject upon selecting a job -- all of these filters are based on the criteria you established when setting up that specific job posting.
</p>
<br />
<div style="text-align:center; margin:auto; padding-top:5px; padding-bottom:5px;"><img src="images/jobautofiller.jpg" />
</div>
<br />
<p><b>Step 3: Mark teachers you'd like to easily keep track of as "Favorites" by clicking the star under their Match Score; this enables you to easily track and manage your favorite teachers for each job.</b>  When you favorite teachers, they will receive an email indicating that you are interested in them and they will appear in your "Favorites" section of the Teachers tab, and on the "candidates" section of your Dashboard as a candidate for the job selected.
</p>
<br />
<div style="text-align:center; margin:auto; padding-top:5px; padding-bottom:5px;"><img src="images/fav.jpg" />

<br />
<p><b>Step 4: Reach out to teachers that you've favorited to learn more about them or to encourage them to apply for additional roles at your school.</b> Once you favorite a teacher, go to the favorites tab; messaging a teacher is as easy as clicking the envelope beneath their apple Match Score, the envelope next to their name in the dashboard, or the envelope in their profile. You can view your entire messaging history with any given candidate by clicking this envelope.

The Core Beliefs Profile is a simple 5-10 minute survey-like questionnaire designed to determine the level of alignment between your views on educational mission and culture and that of the school administration, and speaks to the likelihood that a teacher will be happy at that school long term.  myEDmatch will use the results of your Core Beliefs Profile to suggest schools with similar educational missions, beliefs, and goals as your own.
</p>
<p>The questionnaire includes seven core areas of education:
<ul class="numberlist" style="padding-left:15px;">
<li>Mission -  a shared set of beliefs around the purpose, goals, and aspirations of a school</li>
<li>Instruction - a specific approach to teaching and learning used in a school</li>
<li>Professional Development - support of teachers' professional growth and advancement</li>
<li>Planning - organization around the task of teaching and learning</li>
<li>Student Culture - students' shared beliefs, values, and behaviors concerning school</li>
<li>School Environment - the management of time, people, and resources through systems and structures</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Within each area is a series of statements, about which you will select the degree to which you agree or disagree. To do so, just click on the radio button indicating your level of agreement for each statement. Don't forget to click Save after completing each core section. It should take you no more than 5-10 minutes to complete. Once you've completed this profile, you can begin searching for jobs that are right for you using our more than 20 filters via the "Jobs" tab!

Whether you're looking for your first job, your next job, or a place to showcase the awesome work you're doing in your current job, building a visually-compelling digital professional portfolio is the place to start. In addition to the basics, like detailing your education and experience, your professional profile lets you showcase yourself to schools and other teachers in a way a traditional resume can't. And the best part is, you can build it quickly and easily by following the steps below. 
</p>
<br />
<div style="padding-top:15px; padding-bottom:15px; text-align:center; margin:auto; background:#83b666; width:470px;">
<p style="text-align:left; color:#fff; font-size:14px; font-family:Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; width:425px;"><img src="images/tip_icon.png" align="left" style="padding-right:10px;" /><b>ExpertTip:</b> If you complete your profile, as reflected by the profile completion bar in the top-right corner, you can unlock premium features, which include the following: Match Scores, messaging with schools, and the ability to see which schools have favorited you. A complete profile is at least one entry in each of the 10 profile sections. <a href="#"><b>Learn more >></b></a>
</p>
</div>
<br />
<p><b>Step 1: Complete the 'header' section by adding a profile picture, First Impression, and resume.</b> This section of your profile is important because it's the first thing school recruiters and principals see when they view your profile. In other words, it's your virtual first impression.
</p>
<p>To add your profile picture, hover over the default image and click <b>Upload Profile Picture</b> (#1).
</p>
<p>To write your First Impression, click <b>edit</b>, which will open up a text field where you can craft a 140-character introduction (#2). This is a great place to share what you stand for! 
</p>
<p>To upload your resume, click on the <b>Upload Resume</b> button (#3). A blue icon will appear below the button when your resume has been successfully uploaded.
</p>
<div style="text-align:center; margin:auto; padding-top:10px; padding-bottom:10px;"><img src="images/profileheader.png" /></div>
<br />
<p><b>Step 2: Add your work, education, and leadership experience.</b> Continue building your professional profile and portfolio by adding your personal details, including photos and videos, in each section. Just click <b>Add New</b> or <b>Upload</b> in the upper-right corner of each section. Make sure to hit <b>Save</b> then <b>Done</b> when uploading content.

So, the Endorsements section of your profile makes it easy for you to invite others to vouch for your skills. 
</p>
<p>Just click <b>Request Endorsements</b> and then select from whom you'd like to receive an endorsement.

				<div class='content'>
<p>The Core Beliefs Profile provides us a glimpse into your school's mission, culture, and instructional model. Taking no more than 5-10 minutes to complete, we use this profile to determine how good of a "fit" an applicant is for your specific school. <b>To promote retention, Principals are the only individuals at schools who can fill out the Core Beliefs Profile.</b> This is because school leaders are integral to the culture of school, and study after study have shown that misalignment with the mission, vision, and culture set by the school's administration is the primary driver of teacher attrition.  Your specific answers to each question will be kept private and will not be shared with potential candidates, but our "Match Score" is calculated on the basis of your answers to these questions.
</p>
<br />
<p>Here's how principals complete the Core Beliefs Profile:
</p>
<p><b>Step 1: When your school account has been activated, your principal will receive an email prompting for password reset. Principals will need to follow the link in that initial email to update their password and begin filling out some basic information and the Core Beliefs Profile.
</b></p>
<br />
<div style="padding-top:15px; padding-bottom:15px; text-align:center; margin:auto;"><img src="images/mempassword.jpg" /></div>

<p><b>Step 2: Upon password reset, when you log into the system, you will need to fill in some basic demographic information about yourself and your school.

<br />
<p><b>Step 3: The last step is to respond to questions about your school's mission, staff culture, professional development, instruction, planning, student culture, and school environment.</b> Once you have completed this brief, 5-10 minute survey, you will be able to access our portal, view Culture Match Scores and use our arsenal of convenience features.

Taking the time to create a compelling profile now can help attract great candidates, whereas a profile that is less well-managed could turn potential candidates away.
</p>
</div>
<br />
<p><b>Step 1: Start by adding your school's logo to your profile.</b> Simply "hover" (put your mouse over) the circle image until you see text that says "Upload Profile Picture."

<div style="padding-top:15px; padding-bottom:15px; text-align:center; margin:auto;"><img src="images/profilepic.jpg" />
</div>
<br />
<p>You can also upload a background image to the horizontal box at the top of your page. You can upload an image of any size into this box. Smaller images will be placed on a black "chalkboard" background as in the above image. If you don't like the chalkboard border around your image, you can upload an image that is 1280 pixels by 275 pixels. If you don't have software that allows you to do this easily, try using the free photo cropping tool at <a href="http://www.fotor.com/features/crop.html" target="_blank">www.fotor.com</a>.
</p>
<br />
<p><b>Step 2: Fill in written content on your public profile.</b> The information in the green circles will have been automatically filled based upon the principal's answers to the initial school demographic section during sign-up. If these sections are blank, please ask your principal to complete the 5-10 minute profile. You will not be able to see match scores of candidates until the principal completes this brief survey. Once this is completed, in the Public profile, sections we encourage you to complete include: "Our Mission," "Student Achievement Results," "In Our Own Words,"  "Leadership Opportunities," and "Living Here," in addition to uploading photos or videos to the "slider" sections as described in the next section.

				<div class='content'>
<p>Before you can see match scores, your principal will need to complete a Core Beliefs Profile. This will take your principal no more than 5-10 minutes. We use this Core Beliefs Profile to determine how good of a "fit" an applicant is for your specific school. <b><i>To promote retention, Principals are the only individuals at schools who can fill out the Core Beliefs Profile.</i></b> This is because school leaders are integral to the culture of school, and study after study have shown that misalignment with the mission, vision, and culture set by the school’s administration is the primary driver of teacher attrition.  Your specific answers to each question will be kept private and will not be shared with potential candidates, but our "Match Score" is calculated on the basis of your answers to these questions. If you are not seeing Match Scores, please have your principal fill out the Core Beliefs Profile. If your principal cannot find the initial email we sent out to set up his or her account, please ask us about this by clicking the "Need Help" button on the upper right hand side of your screen and filling out a case.

<p>Completing your public profile on myEDmatch is quick and intuitive, and is the easiest way to market your school and attract potential candidates. Follow the steps below to build a profile that is compelling and that introduces potential candidates to your school.

Taking the time to create a compelling profile now can help attract great candidates, whereas a profile that is less well-managed could turn potential candidates away.
</p>
</div>
<br />
<p><b>Step 1: Start by adding your school's logo to your profile.</b> Simply "hover" (put your mouse over) the circle image until you see text that says "Upload Profile Picture."

<br />
<p>You can also upload a background image to the horizontal box at the top of your page. You can upload an image of any size into this box. Smaller images will be placed on a black "chalkboard" background as in the above image. If you don't like the chalkboard border around your image, you can upload an image that is 1280 pixels by 275 pixels. If you don't have software that allows you to do this easily, try using the free photo cropping tool at <a href="http://www.fotor.com/features/crop.html" target="_blank">www.fotor.com</a>.
</p>
<br />
<p><b>Step 2: Fill in written content on your public profile.</b> The information in the green circles will have been automatically filled based upon the principal's answers to the initial school demographic section during sign-up. If these sections are blank, please ask your principal to complete the 5-10 minute profile. You will not be able to see match scores of candidates until the principal completes this brief survey. Once this is completed, in the Public profile, sections we encourage you to complete include: "Our Mission," "Student Achievement Results," "In Our Own Words,"  "Leadership Opportunities," and "Living Here," in addition to uploading photos or videos to the "slider" sections as described in the next section.

Archiving your jobs that have already been filled will prevent your jobs tab from becoming cluttered.

<p>The Core Beliefs Profile is a simple 5-10 minute survey-like questionnaire designed to determine the level of alignment between your views on educational mission and culture and that of the school administration, and speaks to the likelihood that a teacher will be happy at that school long term.  myEDmatch will use the results of your Core Beliefs Profile to suggest schools with similar educational missions, beliefs, and goals as your own. 
</p>
<p>
The questionnaire includes seven core areas of education:
<ul class="numberlist" style="padding-left:20px;">
<li>Mission -  a shared set of beliefs around the purpose, goals, and aspirations of a school</li>
<li>Instruction - a specific approach to teaching and learning used in a school</li>
<li>Professional Development - support of teachers' professional growth and advancement</li>
<li>Planning - organization around the task of teaching and learning</li>
<li>Student Culture - students' shared beliefs, values, and behaviors concerning school</li>
<li>School Environment - the management of time, people, and resources through systems and structures</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Within each area is a series of statements, about which you will select the degree to which you agree or disagree. To do so, just click on the radio button indicating your level of agreement for each statement. Don't forget to click <b>Save</b> after completing each core section. It should take you no more than 5-10 minutes to complete. Once you've completed this profile, you can begin searching for jobs that are right for you using our more than 20 filters via the "Jobs" tab!

Whether you're looking for your first job, your next job, or a place to showcase the awesome work you're doing in your current job, building a visually-compelling digital professional portfolio is the place to start. In addition to the basics, like detailing your education and experience, your professional profile lets you showcase yourself to schools and other teachers in a way a traditional resume can't. And the best part is, you can build it quickly and easily by following the steps below. 
</p>
<br />
<div style="padding-top:15px; padding-bottom:15px; text-align:center; margin:auto; background:#83b666; width:470px;">
<p style="text-align:left; color:#fff; font-size:14px; font-family:Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; width:425px;"><img src="images/tip_icon.png" align="left" style="padding-right:10px;" /><b>ExpertTip:</b> If you complete your profile, as reflected by the profile completion bar in the top-right corner, you can unlock premium features, which include the following: Match Scores, messaging with schools, and the ability to see which schools have favorited you. A complete profile is at least one entry in each of the 10 profile sections. <a href="#"><b>Learn more >></b></a>
</p>
</div>
<br />
<p><b>Step 1: Complete the 'header' section by adding a profile picture, First Impression, and resume.</b> This section of your profile is important because it's the first thing school recruiters and principals see when they view your profile. In other words, it's your virtual first impression.
</p>
<p>To add your profile picture, hover over the default image and click <b>Upload Profile Picture</b> (#1).
</p>
<p>To write your First Impression, click <b>edit</b>, which will open up a text field where you can craft a 140-character introduction (#2). This is a great place to share what you stand for! 
</p>
<p>To upload your resume, click on the <b>Upload Resume</b> button (#3). A blue icon will appear below the button when your resume has been successfully uploaded.
</p>
<div style="text-align:center; margin:auto; padding-top:10px; padding-bottom:10px;"><img src="images/profileheader.png" /></div>
<br />
<p><b>Step 2: Add your work, education, and leadership experience.</b> Continue building your professional profile and portfolio by adding your personal details, including photos and videos, in each section. Just click <b>Add New</b> or <b>Upload</b> in the upper-right corner of each section. Make sure to hit <b>Save</b> then <b>Done</b> when uploading content.

<div style="padding-top:15px; padding-bottom:15px; text-align:center; margin:auto;"><img src="images/workexperience.png" /></div>
<br />
<p><b>Step 3: Add endorsements from administrators, colleagues, professors, even students and parents.</b> When principals and recruiters hear: "Hire, [Insert Your Name Here]!" from people who know your work, they get excited. So, the Endorsements section of your profile makes it easy for you to invite others to vouch for your skills. 
</p>
<p>Just click <b>Request Endorsements</b> and then select from whom you'd like to receive an endorsement. 
</p>
<br />
<div style="padding-top:15px; padding-bottom:15px; text-align:center; margin:auto;"><img src="images/requestendorsements.png" /></div>

<div style="padding-top:15px; padding-bottom:15px; text-align:center; margin:auto;"><img src="images/requestendorsements2.png" /></div>
<p><b>Step 4: (Optional) Link to your DonorsChoose.org account.</b> Click <b>Add</b> in the upper-right corner of the portfolio section under Leadership. Enter your DonorsChoose.org ID number. 
</p>
<p>If you don't know your number, log into your DonorsChoose.org account, place your cursor over you name in the upper-right corner, and click <b>Account</b>. Scroll to the bottom of the page where your <b>Teacher ID Number</b> is listed. Copy it over to your myEDmatch profile, and you're all set!
</p>
<p><b>Step 5: (Optional) Ask a mentor to review your profile and make notes for improvement.</b> Click <b>Share Private Link with Mentor</b> and you can either retrieve your personal myEDmatch URL to share directly with your mentor or myEDmatch can send a request via email for you.

				<div class='content'>
<p>myEDmatch promotes mission and culture alignment by connecting schools and teachers with shared educational beliefs and goals, with the goal of helping schools and teachers find a match that they will be happy with and will last in the long term. We provide teachers with their dream job opportunities and help them thrive in their careers. 
</p>
<p>Unlike job boards, teachers can use myEDmatch to:
<ul style="padding-left:20px;">
<li>Build a professional teaching portfolio that can be shared publicly</li>
<li>Get matched to schools based on mission, cultural, and instructional alignment to help encourage successful school:teacher matches for the long term</li>
<li>Search for their dream jobs based on the criteria that matters most to them, offering over 20 different search filters</li>
<li>Communicate with and apply for positions at their favorite schools</li>
<li>Get discovered by schools looking for teachers just like them</li>
</ul>

				<li><b><a href='#' class='head'>How does matching work?</a></b>
				<div class='content'>
<p>Match scores represent the degree of similarity or disparity between a teacher's and school's educational alignment within seven core areas of education: mission, instruction, professional development, planning, student culture, staff culture, and school environment. 
</p>
<p>This alignment is assessed using the Core Beliefs Profile, which both teachers and schools complete upon joining myEDmatch, and speaks to the likelihood that a teacher will be happy at that school long term.
</p>
<p>Match Scores are represented by apples, with five apples suggesting a complete beliefs match and zero apples suggesting a complete beliefs mismatch. To view Match Scores on myEDmatch, you'll first need to unlock premium features for free by completing your professional profile to 100% or by paying $8.00/month. Click here to learn more.

<div class='content'>
<p>School leaders look for a completed professional profile. They have indicated that they look first for work experience, evidence of impact (student achievement scores and other accomplishments), and a sample teaching video. Beyond that, there are a number of things you can do to build a profile that really stands out. In fact, we have checklists to help you do just that.

<p>Many teachers don't have a sample teaching video, so having one will really make you stand out in a crowded, competitive market. In fact, many schools actually filter their searches so they can quickly and easily identify the teachers who've uploaded sample teaching videos.
</p>
<p>But no worries if you don't have one yet. The process of creating a teaching video can take a little time, but it's worth it.

<li><b><a href='#' class='head'>How do I add student achievement data to my profile without violating privacy laws?</a></b>
<div class='content'>
<p>You're probably aware of The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), a federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. Learn more about FERPA <a href="http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. It's possible, however, to communicate your student achievement results without disclosing the names of individual students. We recommend either sharing your classes' aggregate results (i.e. 93% of students scored a 4 or higher on the Kansas State Reading Assessment) or uploading data trackers without names or with faux names.

<li><b><a href='#' class='head'>How can I find the status of my application?</a></b>
<div class='content'>
<p>You can keep track of the jobs you've applied to from Homeroom > Jobs You're Interested In or Jobs > Interested tabs. As schools update the status of your application, it will be reflected in each of these places. You'll also receive an email from myEDmatch. 
</p>
<p>The different statuses include: Applied, Resume &amp; Portfolio Review, Phone Screen, 1st Round Interview, 2nd Round Interview, Referral/Background Check, Hired, or Rejected.

<li><b><a href='#' class='head'>How do I communicate with schools?</a></b>
<div class='content'>
<p>In order to communicate with schools via messaging on myEDmatch, you'll first need to unlock premium features for free by completing your professional profile to 100% or by paying $8.00/month. Click here to learn more.  
</p>
<p>A complete professional profile constitutes having at least one entry in each of the following sections:
<ul style="padding-left:20px;">
<li>Profile Picture</li>
<li>First Impression</li>
<li>Resume</li>
<li>Work Experience</li>

<p>Once you've unlocked premium features, messaging is 1:1, meaning you get one response for every message a school sends you, so make it count!  This ensures that school principals and recruiters aren't inundated with messages from teachers, and ultimately makes the application and selection process move along more quickly for everyone.
